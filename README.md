  What is Maven repository used for?  
  <br>
A repository in Maven holds build artifacts and dependencies of varying types. There are exactly two types of repositories: local and remote: the local repository is a directory on the computer where Maven runs. It caches remote downloads and contains temporary build artifacts that you have not yet released.
